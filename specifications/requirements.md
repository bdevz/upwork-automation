# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Upwork Automation System is designed to automate the job discovery, proposal generation, and application submission process for Salesforce Agentforce Developer positions. The system will scale from manual applications (2-3 per day) to automated applications (20-30 per day) while maintaining platform compliance and account safety. The system operates locally with integrations to cloud services for enhanced capabilities.
